# Healthcare Appointment Booking - Development Notes

## Project Overview
A modern healthcare appointment booking application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Architecture Decisions

### Frontend Framework
- **React 18.3.1**: Chosen for its mature ecosystem and excellent TypeScript support
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and better developer experience
- **Vite**: Fast build tool with excellent development experience

### State Management
- **React Context API**: Centralized state management for application data
- **useReducer**: Complex state logic handling for appointments and doctor data

### Styling Approach
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid development
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint-specific styling
- **Design System**: 8px grid system with consistent color palette

### Component Architecture
- **Modular Components**: Reusable UI components with clear separation of concerns
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulated logic for state management
- **TypeScript Interfaces**: Comprehensive type definitions for all data structures
